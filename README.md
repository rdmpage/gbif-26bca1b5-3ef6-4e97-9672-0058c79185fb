3i - Cicadellinae Database
=========================================

3i - Cicadellinae Database from GBIF http://www.gbif.org/dataset/26bca1b5-3ef6-4e97-9672-0058c79185fb

The Darwin Core Archive for this data set http://ctap.inhs.uiuc.edu/dmitriev/Export/DwCArchive_Cicadellinae.zip (downloaded 2013-11-06) has an extra field in the meta.xml file that results in the columns in occurrence.txt being misaligned. As a result, GBIF has not harvested any georeferenced data.
